    /*Inheritance vs Interface
    Inheritance is the adoption of all non-private properties and methods of one class (superclass)
    by another class (subclass), it is a way to make a copy of an existing class as the starting point for another,
    also called derived classes.
    Interfaces define ony the structure of teh class members while inherited classes include the actual code of the superclass.
    Inheritance uses the keyword extends.
    To execute the inherited code from within the subclass the method must include the "super" prefix.
    ex super.methodName()
    Inheritance promotes code reuse and the concept of generic-to-specific implementation.
    Superclasses will be written at the most generic level, subclasses can be created from superclass with a finer more specific purpose.
